### Using custom nodes

To create nodes with custom styling, you will need to create a custom node component, which your `customComponentFactory` will return.

To do this, you will need:

- A `CustomNode` component, with `CustomNodeProps` as the generic type, and the destructured `element` as the parameter. The code in the example shows how you can get data from `element` and apply it to the attributes of `DefaultNode`.

Within each node in your `NODES` array, you can set `data` to include additional custom attributes.

```ts file='./TopologyCustomNodesDemo.tsx'
```
