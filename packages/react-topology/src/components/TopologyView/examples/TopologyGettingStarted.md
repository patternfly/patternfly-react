Note: Topology lives in its own package at [`@patternfly/react-topology`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@patternfly/react-topology)

To use React Topology out-of-the-box, you will first need to transform your back-end data into a [Model](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/main/packages/react-topology/src/types.ts#L16-L20). These model objects contain the information needed to display the nodes and edges. Each node and edge has a set of properties used by PF Topology as well as a data field which can be used to customize the nodes and edges by the application.

  ColaLayout,
  DefaultEdge,
  DefaultGroup,
  DefaultNode,
  EdgeStyle,
  GraphComponent,
  ModelKind,
  NodeShape,
  SELECTION_EVENT,
  Visualization,
  VisualizationProvider,
  VisualizationSurface
} from '@patternfly/react-topology';

### Getting started with react-topology

1. Create a new Controller which can be done using the default `Visualization` class.

  It is important to note that three `register` methods are accessed by the controller.

  The following two must be declared explicitly:

    - `registerLayoutFactory`: This method sets the layout of your topology view (e.g. Force, Dagre, Cola, etc.). If your application supports all layouts, use `defaultLayoutFactory` as a parameter. If you only want to support a subset of the available layout options, update `defaultLayout` to a custom implementation .

    - `registerComponentFactory`: This method lets you customize the components in your topology view (e.g. nodes, groups, and edges). You can use `defaultComponentFactory` as a parameter.

  The register method below is initialized in `Visualization.ts`. It doesn't need to be declared unless you support a custom implementation which modifies the types.

    - `registerElementFactory`: This method sets the types of the elements being used (e.g. graphs, nodes, edges). `defaultElementFactory` uses types from `ModelKind` and is exported in `index.ts`.


2. The `fromModel` method must be called on the controller to create the nodes. `fromModel` will take your data model as a parameter. Your data model should include a `graph` object, on which you will need to set `id` , `type` and `layout`.

3. To create your topology view component, add a `VisualizationProvider`, which is a useful context provider. It allows access to the created Controller and is required when using the `VisualizationSurface` component.

4. You can use the provided `VisualizationSurface` to provide the SVG component required for the topology components. The `VisualizationSurface` can take a state parameter that will allow you to pass your state settings along to the Controller.
