### Topology with a control bar

To add a control bar to the topology view, wrap your `VisualizationProvider` with the `TopologyView` component, which accepts `controlBar` as a prop.

Pass the `TopologyControlBar` component to the `controlBar` prop, and pass the `controlButtons` prop into `TopologyControlBar`. Then call the function `createTopologyControlButtons`, which will create the common control buttons via several parameters listed below:

1. To render the default control buttons, pass in `defaultControlButtonsOptions`. These default options include:
     - Zoom In
     - Zoom Out
     - Fit to Screen
     - Reset View
     - Legend

    You can override these defaults by passing in any of the `defaultControlButtonsOptions` as a parameter, with your updated boolean value of the default option.

2. For each button, pass in each action callback method as parameter.

```ts file="./TopologyControlBarDemo.tsx"
```
