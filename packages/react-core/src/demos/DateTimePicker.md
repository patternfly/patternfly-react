## Demos

In this demo, learn how to use a [CalendarMonth](/components/calendar-month) component and a [Dropdown](/components/dropdown) component to compose a simple DateTimePicker. The input is read only, meaning that the following example does not cover pasting a copied date and time. Also, you can pick the time only from the predefined options and cannot change it in the input.

### Date and time picker

```ts file="./examples/DateTimePicker/DateTimePicker.tsx"
```
