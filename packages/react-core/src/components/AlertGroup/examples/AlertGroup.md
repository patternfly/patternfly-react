## Examples

### Variants

Alert groups utilize the same variants that are available to [alert components](components/alert/). You can add multiple alert variants to each group.

**Static alert group**

Static alert groups appear when the page loads. They are seen within the normal page content flow. They will not be announced individually or explicitly to assistive technology.

```ts file="./AlertGroupStatic.tsx"
```

### Toast alert groups

Toast alerts appear in groups on top of content at the top right of the page. Click the buttons in the example below to simulate toast alerts on this webpage.

Alerts that are asynchronously appended into dynamic `AlertGroups` with `isLiveRegion` will be announced to assistive technology at the moment the change happens, following the strategy used for `aria-atomic`, which defaults to `false`. This means only changes of type `addition` will be announced.

```ts file="./AlertGroupToast.tsx"
```

**With overflow capture**

After a specified number of alerts displayed is reached, users will see an overflow message instead of new alerts. In the following example, an overflow message will appear when more than four alerts are queued.

```ts file="AlertGroupToastOverflowCapture.tsx" isBeta
```

### Dynamic alert groups 

Dynamic alerts are generated after the page initially loads. Additional measures are required to ensure these alerts are accessible to screen readers.

**Singular dynamic alert groups**

These alerts will appear within the page, most likely in response to a user action.

```ts file="./AlertGroupSingularDynamic.tsx"
```

**With overflow message**

In the following example, there can be a max of four alerts shown at once, based on the value of `maxDisplayed`. If there are more than the set maximum of alerts on a page, an overflow message will appear, which users can click on to see the full list of alerts. You may adjust the maximum number of allowed alerts as needed.

Alerts asynchronously appended into dynamic alert groups with `isLiveRegion` will be announced to assistive technology at the moment the change happens. When the overflow message appears in an `AlertGroup` with `isLiveRegion`, the "view 1 more alert" text label will be read, but the alert message will not be read. 

Screen reader and keyboard users will need a way to navigate to and reveal the hidden alerts before they disappear. Alternatively, there should be a place where notifications or alerts are collected to be viewed or read later. 

```ts file="AlertGroupSingularDynamicOverflow.tsx" isBeta
```

**Multiple dynamic alert group**

You may generate multiple alerts within a group at once in response to a user action. The following example adds three alerts per button click.

```ts file="./AlertGroupMultipleDynamic.tsx"
```

### Async alert group

This example shows how an alert could be triggered by an asynchronous event in the application. You can customize how the alert will be announced to assistive technology via the `aria-live` property. Click the "start async" alert button below and then click the alert generator buttons in other examples to demonstrate how this may work in practice. Click the "stop async alerts" button to halt this behavior.

See the alert [group accessibility tab](components/alert-group/accessibility) for more information on the customization options.

```ts file="./AlertGroupAsync.tsx"
```
