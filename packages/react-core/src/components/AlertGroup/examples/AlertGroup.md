## Examples

### Variants 

Alert groups can be the following variants: 
| Variant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Static inline | Static inline alert groups contain alerts that appear when the page loads, and are seen within the normal page content flow. Static alert groups should not contain alerts that will dynamically appear or update. |
| Toast (dynamic) | Toast alert groups position alerts on top of other content at the top right of the page. |
| Dynamic | Dynamic alert groups appear in line with the page's content flow, often in response to a user action.|  

Dynamic alerts are generated after the page initially loads. Additional measures are required to ensure these alerts are accessible to screen readers.

### Static inline alert group

Alert groups may combine multiple [alert variants](components/alert/), as shown in the following static alert group example.

```ts file="./AlertGroupStatic.tsx"
```

### Toast alert group

Alerts that are asynchronously appended into dynamic `AlertGroups` with `isLiveRegion` will be announced to assistive technology at the moment the change happens, following the strategy used for `aria-atomic`, which defaults to `false`. This means only changes of type `addition` will be announced.

The following example uses `isLiveRegion` to add toast alerts to a group after a button click, but does not set `aria-atomic` to `addition`.

```ts file="./AlertGroupToast.tsx"
```

### Toast alert group with overflow capture

After a specified number of alerts displayed is reached, users will see an overflow message instead of new alerts. In the following example, an overflow message will appear when more than four alerts are queued.

When the overflow message appears in an `AlertGroup` with `isLiveRegion`, the "view 1 more alert" text label will be read, but the alert message will not be read. 

Screen reader and keyboard users will need a way to navigate to and reveal the hidden alerts before they disappear. Alternatively, there should be a place where notifications or alerts are collected to be viewed or read later. 

```ts file="AlertGroupToastOverflowCapture.tsx" isBeta
```
### Dynamic alert groups

Dynamic alerts are generated after the page initially loads and appear within the normal page content flow. Additional measures are required to ensure these alerts are accessible to screen readers.

Click the buttons in the example below to add different alert variants to a group. 

```ts file="./AlertGroupSingularDynamic.tsx"
```

### Dynamic alert group with overflow message

In the following example, there can be a max of four alerts shown at once, based on the value of `maxDisplayed`. If there are more than the set maximum of alerts on a page, an overflow message will appear, which users can click on to see the full list of alerts. You may adjust the maximum number of allowed alerts as needed.


```ts file="AlertGroupSingularDynamicOverflow.tsx" isBeta
```

### Multiple dynamic alert groups

You may generate multiple alerts within a group at once. Click the "add alert collection" button in the example below to add three toast alerts to a group at once.

```ts file="./AlertGroupMultipleDynamic.tsx"
```

### Asynchronous alert groups

This example shows how alerts can be triggered by an asynchronous event in the application. You can customize how the alert will be announced to assistive technology by adjusting the value of the `aria-live` property. Click the "start async" alert button below and then click the buttons in the above examples to demonstrate how this may work in practice. Click the "stop async alerts" button to halt this behavior.

See the [alert group accessibility tab](/components/alert-group/accessibility) for more information on the customization options.

```ts file="./AlertGroupAsync.tsx"
```
