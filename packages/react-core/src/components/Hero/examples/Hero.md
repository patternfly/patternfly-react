## Examples

### Basic

The `bodyWidth` and `bodyMaxWidth` properties can be used for finer control over the placement of text content within the `<Hero>`, such as if you omit a background image. Be mindful of adjusting these properties when a background image is still present, as you may need to ensure the contrast of text is sufficient should it overlap the image.

When using `gradientLight` or `gradientDark`, check the color contrast to ensure proper accessibility.

```ts file="HeroBasic.tsx"

```
