## Examples

### Basic

When using a `<Hero>` with a background image, you can use the `<HeroBody>` to prevent text content from overlapping the background image, which helps ensure the text is more easily readable. Keep in mind that you should still check the color contrast when using the `gradientLight` or `gradientDark` properties.

You can omit the `<HeroBody>` for finer control over the text placement, or if no background image is applied to the `<Hero>`.

```ts file="HeroBasic.tsx"

```
