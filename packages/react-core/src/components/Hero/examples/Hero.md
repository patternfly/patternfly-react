## Examples

### Basic

To ensure readability and prevent text from overlapping with the background image, use the `<HeroBody>` component. The `<HeroBody>` is optional and can be omitted if there's no background image or if you'd like finer control over text placement.

When using `gradientLight` or `gradientDark`, regardless of the presence of a `<HeroBody>`, check the color contrast to ensure proper accessibility.

```ts file="HeroBasic.tsx"

```
