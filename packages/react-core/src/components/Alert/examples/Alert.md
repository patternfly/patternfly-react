Micro animations have been added for `<Alert>` components within an `<AlertGroup>`. By default, you must opt into animations, since they can require updates to tests. To enable or disable animations as needed, use the `hasAnimations` property. With animations enabled, we recommend you ensure that dynamically-added alerts are prepended to a list of alerts, rather than appended to the end of it.

Micro animations are turned on for all examples and demos where alerts are dynamically added.

## Alert examples

### Alert variants

PatternFly supports several alert variants for different scenarios. Each variant has an associated status icon, background, and alert title coded to communicate the severity of an alert. Use the `variant` property to apply the following styling options. If no `variant` is specified, then the variant will be set to "custom".

| Variant | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Custom  | Use for generic messages that should have a custom color set by the associated CSS variable. Should be used when the message has no associated severity. |
| Info    | Use for general informational messages                                                                                                                   |
| Success | Use to indicate that a task or process has been completed successfully                                                                                   |
| Warning | Use to indicate that a non-critical error has occurred                                                                                                   |
| Danger  | Use to indicate that a critical or blocking error has occurred                                                                                           |

```ts file = "AlertVariants.tsx"

```

### Alert variations

PatternFly supports several properties and variations that can be used to add extra content to an alert.

- As demonstrated in the 1st variation below, use the `actionLinks` property to add one or more `<AlertActionLink>` components that place links beneath the alert message. You must pass in `href` and `component="a"` properties to have an `<AlertActionLink>` act as a proper link, rather than as a button.

- As demonstrated in the 2nd variation below, use a native HTML `<a>` element to add links within an alert message.

- As demonstrated in the 3rd variation below, use the `actionClose` property to add an `<AlertActionCloseButton>` component, which can be used to manage and customize alert dismissals.

- As demonstrated in the 4th and 5th variations below, use the `component` property to set the element for an alert title.
  - If there is not a description passed via `children` prop, then the `component` prop should be set to a non-heading element such as a `span` or `div`.
  - If there is a description passed via `children` prop, then the `component` prop should be a heading element. Headings should be ordered by their level and heading levels should not be skipped. For example, a heading of an `h2` level should not be followed directly by an `h4`.

```ts file = "AlertVariations.tsx"

```

### Alert timeout

Use the `timeout` property to automatically dismiss an alert after a period of time. If set to `true`, the `timeout` will be 8000 milliseconds. Provide a specific value to dismiss the alert after a different number of milliseconds.

```ts file = "AlertTimeout.tsx"

```

### Expandable alerts

An alert can contain additional, hidden information that is made visible when users click a caret icon. This information can be expanded and collapsed each time the icon is clicked.

It is not recommended to use an expandable alert with a `timeout` in a [toast alert group](/components/alert#toast-alert-group) because the alert could timeout before users have time to interact with and view the entire alert.

See the [toast alert considerations](/components/alert/accessibility#toast-alerts) section of the alert accessibility documentation to understand the accessibility risks associated with using toast alerts.

```ts file = "AlertExpandable.tsx"

```

### Truncated alerts

Use the `truncateTitle` property to shorten a long `title`. Set `truncateTitle` equal to a number (passed in as `{n}`) to reduce the number of lines of text in the alert's `title`. Users may hover over or tab to a truncated `title` to see the full message in a tooltip.

```ts file = "AlertTruncated.tsx"

```

### Custom icons

Use the `customIcon` property to replace a default alert icon with a custom icon.

```ts file = "AlertCustomIcons.tsx"

```

### Inline alerts variants

Use inline alerts to display an alert inline with content. All alert variants may use the `isInline` property to position alerts in content-heavy areas, such as within forms, wizards, or drawers.

```ts file = "AlertInlineVariants.tsx"

```

### Inline alert variations

All general alert variations can use the `isInline` property to apply inline styling.

```ts file = "AlertInlineVariations.tsx"

```

### Plain inline alert variants

Use the `isPlain` property to make any inline alert plain. Plain styling removes the colored background but keeps colored text and icons.

```ts file = "AlertPlainInlineVariants.tsx"

```

### Plain inline alert variations

It is not recommended to use a plain inline alert with `actionClose` nor `actionLinks` because these alerts are non-dismissible and should persist until the error or action related to the alert is resolved.

```ts file = "AlertPlainInlineVariations.tsx"

```

### Static live region alerts

Live region alerts allow you to expose dynamic content changes in a way that can be announced by assistive technologies.

By default, `isLiveRegion`alerts are static.

```ts file = "AlertStaticLiveRegion.tsx"

```

### Dynamic live region alerts

Alerts that are asynchronously appended into dynamic [alert groups](/components/alert/#alert-group-examples) via the `isLiveRegion` property will be announced to assistive technology the moment the change happens, following the strategy used for `aria-atomic`, which defaults to false. This means only changes of type "addition" will be announced.

```ts file="AlertDynamicLiveRegion.tsx"

```

### Asynchronous live region alerts

This example shows how an alert could be triggered by an asynchronous event in the application. Note that you can customize how the alert will be announced to assistive technology. See the [alert accessibility](/components/alert/accessibility/) for more information.

```ts file="AlertAsyncLiveRegion.tsx"

```

## Alert group examples

An alert group stacks and positions 2 or more alerts in a live region, either in a layer over the main content of a page or inline with the page content. Alert groups should always rank alerts by age, stacking new alerts on top of old ones as they surface.

### Alert group variants

Alert groups can be one of the following variants:

| Variant       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Static inline | Static inline alert groups contain alerts that appear when the page loads, and are seen within the normal page content flow. These groups should not contain alerts that will dynamically appear or update. |
| Toast         | Toast alert groups contain alerts that typically appear in response to an asynchronous event or user action. These groups are positioned on top of other content at the top right of the page.              |
| Dynamic       | Dynamic alert groups contain alerts that typically appear in response to a user action, and are seen within the normal page content flow.                                                                   |

Dynamic alerts that are generated after the page initially loads must be appended to either a toast or dynamic `AlertGroup`, both of which must use the `isLiveRegion` property. New alerts appended to a toast or dynamic group will be announced by assistive technologies the moment the change happens. For information about customizing this announcement, read the [aria-atomic and aria-relevant](/components/alert/accessibility#aria-atomic-and-aria-relevant) section of the alert accessibility documentation.

### Static inline alert group

All alert group variants may combine multiple [alert variants](/components/alert) For example, the following static inline alert group includes one "success" alert and one "info" alert.

```ts file="AlertGroupStatic.tsx"

```

### Toast alert group

Toast alert groups are created by passing in the `isToast` and `isLiveRegion` properties.

Click the buttons in the example below to add alerts to a toast group.

```ts file="AlertGroupToast.tsx"

```

### Toast alert group with overflow capture

Users will see an overflow message once a predefined number of alerts are displayed. They will not see any alerts beyond the display limit, which must be explicitly set.

In the following example, an overflow message will appear when more than 4 alerts would be shown. When a 5th alert would appear, an overflow message is shown instead.

When an overflow message appears in an `AlertGroup` using the `isLiveRegion` property, the "view 1 more alert" text label will be announced, but the alert message will not.

Users navigating via keyboard or another assistive technology will need a way to navigate to and reveal hidden alerts before they disappear. Alternatively, there should be a place where notifications or alerts are collected to be viewed or read later.

```ts file="AlertGroupToastOverflowCapture.tsx"

```

### Asynchronous alert groups

The following example shows how alerts can be triggered by an asynchronous event in the application. You can customize how an alert will be announced to assistive technology by adjusting the value of the `aria-live` property. Click the "start async" alert button below and then click the buttons in the above toast examples to demonstrate how asynchronous events add alerts to a group. Click the "stop async alerts" button to halt this behavior.

See the [alert accessibility tab](/components/alert/accessibility) for more information on customizing this behavior.

```ts file="AlertGroupAsync.tsx"

```

### Dynamic alert groups

Click the buttons in the example below to add dynamic alerts to a group.

```ts file="AlertGroupSingularDynamic.tsx"

```

### Dynamic alert group with overflow message

In the following example, there can be a maximum of 4 alerts shown at once.

```ts file="AlertGroupSingularDynamicOverflow.tsx"

```

### Multiple dynamic alert groups

You may add multiple alerts to an alert group at once. Click the "add alert collection" button in the example below to add a batch of 3 toast alerts to a group.

```ts file="AlertGroupMultipleDynamic.tsx"

```
