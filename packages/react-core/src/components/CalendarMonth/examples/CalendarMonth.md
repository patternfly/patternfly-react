## Examples

### Selectable date

```ts file="./CalendarMonthSelectableDate.tsx"
```

### Date range

In this example, there are 2 dates selected: a range start date (via the `rangeStart` prop) and a range end date (via the `date` prop). Additionally, any dates prior to the range start date are disabled by passing in an array of functions to the `validators` prop. In this case a single function is passed in, which checks whether a date is greater than or equal to the range start date.

For this example, these dates are static and cannot be updated. For an interactive demo, see our [Date picker demos](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/date-picker/react-demos).

```ts file="./CalendarMonthDateRange.tsx"
```
