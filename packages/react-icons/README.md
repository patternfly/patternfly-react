## Adding Icons

Icons for this package are generated from the `@fontawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` package. To add more to what is generated, modify the [icons.js](./build/icons.js) file in the build folder.

If you have some custom icon defined by svg path the best way to add such icon to this repository is to add it's path definition in [pfIcons.js](./build/pfIcons.js) file in the build folder.
```JS
module.exports = {
  pfIcons: {
    // ... other icon defintions
    bigPlus: {width: 1024, height: 1024, svgPathData: 'M2 1 h1 v1 h1 v1 h-1 v1 h-1 v-1 h-1 v-1 h1 z'}
  }
}
```
