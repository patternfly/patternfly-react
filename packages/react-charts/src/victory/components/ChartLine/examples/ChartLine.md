## Introduction
Note: PatternFly React charts live in its own package at [@patternfly/react-charts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@patternfly/react-charts)!

The examples below are based on the [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/) chart library, along with additional functionality, custom components, and theming for PatternFly. This provides a collection of React based components you can use to build PatternFly patterns with consistent markup, styling, and behavior.

## Examples
### Basic with right aligned legend
```ts file = "ChartLineBasicRightLegend.tsx"

```

### Green with bottom aligned legend

This demonstrates how to combine cursor and voronoi containers to display tooltips along with a cursor.

```ts file = "ChartLineGreenBottomLegend.tsx"

```

### Multi-color (unordered) with responsive container

This demonstrates zoom for the x axis only.

```ts file = "ChartLineMultiColor.tsx"

```

## Documentation
### Tips
- See Victory's [FAQ](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/faq)
- For single data points or zero values, you may want to set the `domain` prop
- `ChartLegend` may be used as a standalone component, instead of using `legendData`
- The `theme` and `themeColor` props should be applied at the most top level component
- Use `ChartGroup` to apply theme color scales and other properties to multiple components
