# @patternfly/react-code-editor

This package provides a PatternFly wrapper for the Monaco code editor

### Prerequisite

#### Node Environment

This project currently supports Node [Active LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) releases. Please stay current with Node Active LTS when developing patternfly-react.

For example, to develop with Node 8, use the following:

```
nvm install 8
nvm use 8
```

This project also requires a Yarn version of >=1.6.0. The latest version can be installed [here](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Installing

yarn add @patternfly/react-code-editor
```

or

```
npm install @patternfly/react-code-editor --save
```

### Usage

#### Pre-requisites

It's strongly advised to use the PatternFly Base CSS in your whole project, or some components may diverge in appearance:

```js
import '@patternfly/react-core/dist/styles/base.css';
```

```js
import { CodeEditor } from '@patternfly/react-code-editor';
```

# Documentation

# Contributing Components

This library makes use of the babel plugin from [@patternfly/react-styles](../react-styles/README.md) to enable providing the CSS alongside the components. This removes the need for consumers to use (style|css|sass)-loaders. For any CSS not provided by core please use the `StyleSheet.create` utility from [@patternfly/react-styles](../react-styles/README.md). This will prevent collisions with any consumers, and allow the CSS to be bundled with the component.

### Building

```
yarn build
```

Note the build scripts for this are located in the root package.json under `yarn build`.
