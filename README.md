This project will provide a set of React UI components for the [PatternFly project](https://patternfly.org).

##  Getting Started
```
npm install --save patternfly-react
```

Then import Patternfly React UI modules as ES6 modules:
```
import { Alert } from 'patternfly-react'
```

## Storybook UI Development
This project uses [React Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/) to test and demo new React UI components. You can view our current storybook [here](https://rawgit.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/gh-pages/index.html).

How to use Storybook locally:
```
npm i
npm start
```

How to deploy storybook to github pages in your fork:
```
npm run storybook:build
npm run storybook:deploy
```

To deploy Storybook to a remote other than `origin`, pass a `--remote` flag to `npm run storybook:deploy`.
For example, to deploy to your `upstream` remote:
```
npm run storybook:deploy -- --remote=upstream
```
To deploy Storybook to a target branch and serve with rawgit instead of gh-pages, pass `--branch` flag to `npm run storybook:deploy`. This will create a new branch to serve your Storybook (and will be useful if you have multiple open pull requests).

For example, say you have `feature-branch`, you can deploy the storybook to a rawgit branch with:
```
npm run storybook:deploy -- --branch=feature-branch-storybook
```
